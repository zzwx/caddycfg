# caddycfg

Tiny library to modify `caddy` server's configuration from the web sites themselves.

## Installation

`go get github.com/zzwx/caddycfg@master`

## Motivation

Playing with `caddy` global configuration made me feel that it would be cool for them to be modular. There might be better solutions for this workflow, but this is what works for my small projects.

It's a work-in-progress project. Feel free to comment or enhance with pull requests.

## Tests Notes

The tests assume that the `caddy` server is available.
